# Trace

#### Trace is a COVID-19 tracking app which shows current stats globally and per country. 

Due to the restrictions in the Google Platstore for COVID-19 apps, I was not able to publish it there. But anyhow, you can download it from the release section in this repository. It is using an API covid19api.com for the data. 

*This app is made using Flutter.*

**If you like the project, show some love by giving a ‚≠ê to this repository. It will mean a lot to me.**
